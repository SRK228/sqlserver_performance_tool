# Database Analysis Documentation

This directory contains a comprehensive analysis of the CONSTRUCTION database structure, performance metrics, and optimization recommendations.

## Analysis Reports

1. **Table Analysis (1_TableAnalysis.md)**
   - Table sizes and row counts
   - Column definitions
   - Space usage
   - Schema information

2. **Stored Procedure Analysis (2_StoredProcedureAnalysis.md)**
   - List of stored procedures
   - Creation and modification dates
   - Complexity analysis
   - Dependencies

3. **Index Analysis (3_IndexAnalysis.md)**
   - Index types and sizes
   - Usage statistics
   - Performance metrics
   - Recommendations for optimization

4. **Table Relationships (4_TableRelationships.md)**
   - Foreign key relationships
   - Table dependencies
   - Data integrity constraints

5. **Stored Procedure Usage (5_TableUsageInSPs.md)**
   - Table usage in stored procedures
   - Procedure dependencies
   - Usage patterns

## Next Steps

After the analysis is complete, we will:

1. Review the generated reports
2. Identify optimization opportunities:
   - Table structure improvements
   - Index optimization
   - Stored procedure simplification
   - Query performance enhancements

3. Create a detailed roadmap for:
   - Critical improvements
   - Performance optimizations
   - Code refactoring
   - Data integrity enhancements

4. Implement changes in phases to minimize impact on the existing system
